## EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CODE RULES FOR THE PROJECT!

1) add the file of your IDE/Development toolchain into gitignore file
if you wanna a tool that help you to create the gitignore use that
website -> https://www.gitignore.io/, after had used that site check
the gitgnore file, maybe not all the files to not push are included

2) use the test development driven filosophy, before write test and
after write code

3) NO SPOILER ON AVENGERS GAME

4) write in english

5) use data structure (queque,heap,list,hash table). Possibily use the C++
standard module, remember:
"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships." Linus Torwald

6) ask but with sense, before search on google the more trivial things

7) NO VARIABLES OR METHODS WITH ITALIAN! An engineer must use english!

8) share ideas and conceptual problems, more mind are better than once

9) before write code think about the general structure of you're library
a good design avoid problems, also think about common sense names
