# SimulPad

Cooperative text editing system that allows one or more users to edit the content of a document simultaneously ensuring that different insertion or editing operations, carried out by users at the same time, produce the same effects, regardless of the order in which they are performed on different systems in use (commutativity) and that repeated deletions lead to the same result (idempotency). Very much like Google Docs.

It includes features of:
- Copy-Paste
- Different styles: bold, italic, underline, font and size, alignment, ...
- Exporting PDF of the document
- Invite to collaborate via email URI
