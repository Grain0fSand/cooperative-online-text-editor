## EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CODE RULES FOR THE PROJECT!

1) add the file of your IDE/Development toolchain into gitignore file
if you wanna a tool that help you to create the gitignore use that
website -> https://www.gitignore.io/, after had used that site check
the gitgnore file, maybe not all the files to not push are included


2) please create a branch with your name and ask to join on the main
branch only when you have TESTED you're code

3) use the test development driven filosophy, before write test and
after write code

4) write in english

5) COMMENT COMMENT AND COMMENT YOU'RE CODE, the others are not in your
mind please use the words to explain the more complex part of the code

6) use data structure (queque,heap,list,hash table). Possibily use the C++
standard module, remember:
"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships." Linus Torwald

7) please update the others, we can decide to use telegram, slack, mail ecc ecc but once
that the project is divided please periodically push updates and news

8) ask but with sense, before search on google the more trivial things

9) NO VARIABLES OR METHODS WITH ITALIAN! An engineer must use english!

10) share ideas and conceptual problems, more mind are better than once

11) before write code think about the general structure of you're library
a good design avoid problems, also think about common sense names

12) enjoy the code and the project, is an hard project but if we start well
surely we will take a good mark!
